# Welding Headgear Adaptor 
These files help use a welding headgear with the Deck X. This is particularly helpful if you have a smaller head, as the Miller Gen II mechanism used in the Deck X does not tighten up _that_ much. They were mainly designed by Juraj Vincur, I added the rail attachment mechanism onto the existing Deck X brake housing.

## What to print
Everything twice, but flip on the x-axis the brake housing, brake cover, and mount. (denoted with \_L in their names)

## Print Settings
- PolyTerra PLA at 210C on a 60C bed
- 0.12 Height
- 100% infill

## What to buy 
The headgear I used: [Bolle Adgustable Headgear for Flash Helmet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Boll%C3%A9-Adjustable-Headgear-Flash-Helmet/dp/B01GH48KZE/ref=asc_df_B01GH48KZE/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=218100548040&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12668640904651476154&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006661&hvtargid=pla-350204018578&psc=1&th=1&psc=1)
